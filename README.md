Java Useful Functions
=====================
These are some useful functions in Java that I've developed for my own projects. Although they were thought to be used in them, please, feel free to adapt them as you may need. 

How to use them
-----------------------------------------------------
Folders hold functions that need to be together. Most them may be used in any IDE and/or version of Visual Studio.

License
-----------------------------------------------------
I am not asking to follow a license here since anyone could program them, but to be given some credit if you take them would lovely =)
